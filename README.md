# Drank Full Stack Application
Drank is a full-stack application that lets users create and save interesting cocktails. A user signs up and then proceeds to log in whereupon they create drinks. The user can then access their created drinks and edit them as they please (including deletions).

## Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- jQuery/AJAX
- Handlebars
- Ruby on Rails
- Photoshop
- Illustrator

## Version 1
My intent for this project was to have 2 simple tables: a users table and a drinks table. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, however, I was then advised to use a joins table (which I ended up not using). I started off by creating the back end and scaffolding my individual tables. Then I created my joins table and proceeded to start making my front end. I then proceeded to work on my front end where I used very basic Bootstrap and worked on user authentication. After completing this, I worked on the CRUD actions for my drinks table. My last step was adding basic styling.

## Version 2
My second and most recent version dealt with the goal of cleaning up my code and creating a nicer presentation of the app. I knew I wanted a rustic feel so I began by starting with the styling. I then proceeded to work on the functionality of elements as I ran across them. Essentially, I started at the begining with auth and worked my way up the chain. My first version only saved drink names. In this version I save all information created by the user. This required some changes to the backend, including adding first & last name to the users table. I also wanted to make my code as reusable as possible. I began refactoring it and attempted to use Handlebars in as many places as possible.

## Next Steps
Upon further work, I'd love to make my app fully responsive. Since I'm already using Bootstrap, most of it is already responsive. Next steps would require mostly swapping out images and changing font sizes. I'd also like to add an ingredients joins table as well as allow users to view other users drinks.

## User Stories
As a user, I want the app to be easily navigable so that I don't get lost.
As a user, I want to be able to edit my drinks in case I don't like them.
As a user, I want the site to be visually appealing so that I don't get bored or lose interest.
